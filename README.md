# Genetic_Algorithm

This algorithm allows us to solve the mathematical problem of the traveling agent by applying Darwin's theory of genetics of natural selection. Based on the above, we have a set of N cities, which in this case will be our population, then with this we proceed to perform genetic assemblies and mutations of many generations where the best solution will be taken as the one that is best adapted to these changes based on measurements called fitness.

 	* Within the code there are comments explaining the functions programmed to operate the algorithm.
